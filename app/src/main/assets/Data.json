          "recipeContent": "A BLT (bacon, lettuce, and tomato) is a perfect sandwich. Some of you are already nodding your heads in approval, but for others that need convincing: a BLT sandwich hits on so many levels. Its deceptive simplicity might fool you into thinking you need more complex components to make something tasty; its ubiquity on diner menus which may use less-than-ideal ingredients (a mealy tomato can ruin a BLT) might have turned you off for good.Im not going to lie: I was once part of this latter group. I believed the BLT was a meh sandwich, and oddly enough, I wasn't convinced of its true power until I went to a cafe that served a BLT crepe with the most perfect tomato I'd ever tasted.I'm here to tell you that the BLT can be absolutely transcendent—if you grab the right ingredients. So save that thick-cut bacon for your breakfast. Steer clear from dry-cured bacon. Here's what you need to know to pick the perfect bacon for a BLT."
